          <h2>Become a Pilot</h2>
          <p>
            I aspire to become a pilot, following in the footsteps of my grandfather. 
            Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by <em>large aircraft</em> and the thrill of traveling to new places. 
            I love meeting new people, embracing diverse cultures, and having a fresh challenge each day. 
            Being 10 kilometers above sea level offers a sense of freedom that few other professions can match.

          <h2>Study Political Science</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve always had a passion for <em>political science</em> and how it shapes our daily lives. 
            Politics influences everything from taxes to personal freedoms, and by understanding this field, 
            I can contribute to fair policies and help make decisions that affect entire communities. 
            It’s a vital discipline that holds great responsibility, and I’m excited to dive deeper into its complexities.

          <h2>Study Economic Science</h2>
          <p>
            Lastly, I plan to study economic science. Understanding how markets function will 
            not only open many career opportunities but also empower me to make informed decisions 
            in my own ventures. I want to use this knowledge to <em>grow my business</em>, scale up 
            operations, and contribute to economic progress. By mastering economics, I hope to 
            create real value and ensure long-term success.
